If
process
P1
sends
a
message
to
process
P2,
then
send(message)
→
receive(message).
This
relationship
signifies
that
a
send
event
must
happen
before
a
receive
event
for
the
same
message.
Transitive
property:
If
a
→
b
and
b
→
c,
then
a
→
c.
In
other
words,
if
A
causally
precedes
B
and
B
causally
precedes
C,
then
A
causally
precedes
C.
Updating
Logical
Timestamps:
Logical
timestamps
are
updated
according
to
the
following
rules:
Before
executing
an
event,
the
process
increments
the
logical
timestamp
by
1:
Logical_timestamp
=
Logical_timestamp
+
1.
This
ensures
that
events
are
assigned
increasing
timestamps.
During
a
send
event,
the
process
increments
the
logical
timestamp
by
1
and
sends
the
timestamp
along
with
the
message:
Logical_timestamp
=
Logical_timestamp
+
1.
During
a
receive
event,
the
recipient
updates
its
logical
timestamp
to
the
maximum
value
between
its
own
Logical_timestamp
and
the
timestamp
received
with
the
message,
and
then
increments
the
timestamp
by
1:
Logical_timestamp
=
max(Logical_timestamp,
time_received)
+
1
